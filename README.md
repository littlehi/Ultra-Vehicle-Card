### Cool Tip

Hey there, fellow Home Assistant enthusiast! üè†‚ú® 

Did you know that the Ultra Vehicle Card was inspired by a midnight coding session fueled by an unhealthy amount of caffeine and a sudden realization that cars deserve cool cards too? It's true!

If this card has made your dashboard a little more awesome or saved you from the treacherous "low fuel surprise," consider buying the developer a virtual Dr Pepper. It helps keep the creativity flowing and the code bug-free!

<img width="300" alt="Icon Grid Tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1927f5c0-977c-4ff4-9bbf-90f83e554e73">

The icon grid allows you to add custom icons representing various entities related to your vehicle. Here's a detailed explanation of each option:

### Adding Entities
1. Use the search bar to find entities you want to add to the grid.
2. Click on an entity from the search results to add it to the grid.
3. The entity will appear in the grid with default settings.

### Row Separators

<img width="300" alt="Separator Options" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/718f5280-e462-4d84-b1a3-9761b4a2b6ca">

Row separators help organize your icons into distinct groups.

1. Click "Add Row Separator" to insert a separator.
2. Configure the separator:
   - **Color**: Choose any color for the separator line.
   - **Height**: Set the thickness of the separator (in pixels).
   - **Icon Gap**: Adjust the space between icons in this row.
   - **Horizontal Alignment**: Determine how icons are aligned horizontally (left, center, right).
   - **Vertical Alignment**: Set how icons align vertically within their row (top, middle, bottom).

### Icon Configuration

<img width="300" alt="Icon Config" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62362632-ea5c-4ae4-a54b-0bc901a6c9c6">

For each icon in the grid, you can customize its appearance and behavior:

#### Icon Selection
- **Inactive Icon**: The icon displayed when the entity is in its "off" or inactive state.
- **Active Icon**: The icon shown when the entity is "on" or active.

To change an icon:
1. Click on the current icon.
2. Search for a new icon or select from the popular icons shown.
3. Click "no-icon" if you don't want an icon for that state.

#### Icon Colors
- **Inactive Color**: The color of the icon in its inactive state.
- **Active Color**: The color when the icon is active.

Use the color picker to select custom colors or input specific hex values.

#### Icon Style
Choose how the icon is displayed:
- **Icon**: Just the icon itself.
- **Round**: Icon within a circular background.
- **Square**: Icon within a square background.
- **Label**: Text label instead of an icon.

#### Icon Size
Adjust the size of the icon in pixels. This setting affects both the icon and its background (if using round or square style).

#### Interaction
Determine what happens when a user clicks the icon:
- **More Info**: Opens the entity's more info dialog.
- **Toggle**: Switches the entity between on and off states.
- **Navigate**: Goes to a specific page in your Home Assistant interface.
- **Open URL**: Opens a specified web address.
- **Assist**: Opens the voice assistant.
- **Trigger**: Activates the entity (useful for automations or scripts).
- **None**: Disables interaction for this icon.

#### Icon Label Position
If you want to display a label with your icon, choose where it appears:
- **None**: No label is shown.
- **Left/Right/Top/Bottom**: Places the label in the specified position relative to the icon.

### State Configuration
This advanced feature allows you to customize when an icon is considered "active" or "inactive". For both active and inactive states, you have these options:

#### Default
When selected, the card uses built-in logic to determine the active state:
- For most entities, "on", "home", "open", "locked", etc. are considered active.
- For numeric sensors, any value above 0 is typically considered active.

#### Template
Allows you to write a custom Jinja2 template to determine the icon state. This is for advanced users who need complex logic. For example:
>{{ states('sensor.temperature') | float > 20 }}
This would make the icon active when the temperature is above 20 degrees.

#### Attribute
You can base the icon state on a specific attribute of the entity. For example, if your car has a "status" attribute, you could set it to be active when status is "driving".

#### Option
For entities that have predefined options (like input_select), you can choose which option represents the active state.

### Practical Example
Let's say you're adding an icon for your car's climate control:
1. Search for and add the climate control entity.
2. Set the inactive icon to "mdi:air-conditioner" and active to "mdi:air-conditioner-on".
3. Choose blue for inactive and red for active colors.
4. Set the style to "Round" for a nice background effect.
5. Set the interaction to "Toggle" so you can turn it on/off directly from the card.
6. Add a label at the bottom showing "Climate".
7. In state configuration, you might use an attribute like "hvac_action" to determine when it's truly active, rather than just being on but not actively cooling/heating.

## Customize Tab

<img width="300" alt="Customize Tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46780552-c508-4380-8a9e-cefb52c8f4a8">
